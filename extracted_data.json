The upload process must strictly adhere to the following rules:\n\nFile Format Validation:\nThe uploaded file must be exactly in the .qsec file format (Quantum Secure Encrypted Container). Any deviation in file format must prompt the message:\n\"Quantum upload rejected: Non-compliant file format detected.\"\n\nQuantum Hash Verification:\nUpon successful upload, the system must automatically execute the NQH validation.\n\nPass Condition: If the quantum hash verification returns a match against the original hash computed by the user\u2019s quantum client application, the system should clearly indicate:\n\"Quantum verification successful: Integrity confirmed.\"\n\nFail Condition: If there\u2019s a hash mismatch or quantum integrity violation, the system must display:\n\"Critical Alert! Quantum hash mismatch detected. Immediate re-upload required.\"\n\nTime-bound Verification:\nThe quantum verification process must complete within exactly 5.5 seconds of upload initiation. Failure to meet this timing requirement mandates an immediate abort of the verification process and displays:\n\"Quantum upload verification failed: Timeout exceeded 5.5-second threshold.\"\n\nLogging Requirements:\nAll outcomes (pass/fail/timeout) from this quantum verification process must be logged in real-time to the secure audit log with a unique identifier pattern:\nQUANTUM-VERIF-[Timestamp]-[8-digit unique numeric ID]"
